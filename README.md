# Plotly-JavaScript-Challenge

## Create a series of functions leveraging d3 to convert JSON into a series of arrays

### Create names array to populate dropdown menu
- iterate through names to create an array of names
- iterate through the array and append to dropdown list using foreach

### Create code block that can leveraged as boiler platefor:
- demographic information
- bar graph
- bubble chart

### Build demographic feed
- create array of demographics
- create filter so that, for each name chosen, the demographic data points will be grabbed and placed with the proper id, assigning based on the proper key and value

### Build bar chart
- create array of sample data, grabbing otu_ids labels to help support 
- use slicer to pull highest 10 samples for each individual
- use Plotly to generat a sorted bar graph

### Build bubble chart
- create array of sample data, grabbing otu_ids labels to enhance visualization
- use slicer to pull highest 10 samples for each individual
- use Plotly to generate  bubble chart
